        Pizza is an Italian food that was created in Italy (The Naples area). It is made with different toppings. Some of the
        most common toppings are cheese, sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs and basil. These toppings
        are added over a piece of bread covered with sauce.
